# Web-Projects
I do some web projects during my bachelor's and master's degrees.

Moboshop - is a website for buying mobile, laptop, and computer accessories. It has two perspectives (user and admin). A user can browse different products and add them to a cart. On the other hand, an admin can add, delete, and edit any product and can see the details of the user and the orders.

df-project-radish-main - is a web application built for Farmbot (a Cartesian coordinate robot). Where a user (farmer) can plan for seeding and watering plants.
